		… ,
		"html5-uploader": {
			...
		}
	});

## Avoiding server max upload size restrictions

To avoid server side max upload size restrictions, following HTML5 options are available

### Chunked upload

Chunked uploading uploads smaller pieces at once, where each piece is smaller than the max size allowed. 

Following setting enables chunked upload (value in bytes):

	"html5-uploader": {
		maxChunkSize: 100000
	}


### Stream upload

Stream uploading uses HTTP PUT method for sending file contents as a stream.

Following client setting that enables stream upload:

	"html5-uploader": {
		multipart: false
	}

Note that setting "`maxChunkSize`" should not be defined (or should be "`false`"), as it applies to non-multipart uploads as well.
